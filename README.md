# KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm with different similarity index and K values
The data set values are attributes of different wines from wine review. A one(1) indicates the presence of an attribute while a zero represent the absence of the attribute. Because of the size of the data set, the program utilized only a subset of the data set because of the time complexity of running the code on entire data set.
To run the codes on the entire data set, delete line 19 of the projects' code
